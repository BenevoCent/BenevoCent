 User’s credit card transactions are rounded up to the nearest dollar and the remainder is donated to a charity of their choice. There is a visual feedback component where the user’s total charitable donations correlate to the size of a virtual “garden”. Multiple users can group up together to contribute to a shared community garden. Gardens can represent specific community interests such as: environmental protection, humanitarian causes, medical research, etc.
